This is my C# conversational and pedagogical agents code.

This project has a long history of creating conversational and pedagogical agents within SecondLife
and Open Simulator (OpenSIM).  It uses the ALICE Bot chatbot technology for conversational and
knowledge encoding, and provides a front-end for creating simulations and integrating bots into
the 3D worlds.
